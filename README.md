### Open Garages - Pages

We are converting the original wiki to github pages.  If you are running an Open Garages, send an email to the
mailing list to have your github account added to this organization.  If you just want to make some changes, feel free
to fork the pages and later make a pull request when you are ready.

We are using (Jukyll)[https://jekyllrb.com/] to manage the pages.  Install that to do local testing and previewing.

This is currently a work-in-progress.  Major issues or questions, contact @zombieCraig
