  "body": "### About Open Garages\r\nOpen Garages are Vehicle Research Labs (VRL) centered around understanding the increasingly complex vehicle systems. Open Garages provide public access, documentation and tools necessary to understand today's modern vehicle systems. With the ever increasing complexity of modern vehicles it is imperative that the community understand how these systems work. With understanding, it is possible to repair the vehicle, improve its capabilities and identify potential security risks. Open Garages provide access to equipment and work to build tools to make further research open and easier to access to other communities through the use of Open Source Hardware and Software wherever possible.\r\n\r\n### Finding or Starting an Open Garages\r\nWith any luck, there is an Open Garages located somewhere in your area.  You can check _here_ to see if one is located in the directory.\r\n\r\nIf not, do not worry.  You should start one.  It's really easy, I promise!  You will simply have to pick a meeting time (example: First Saturday of the month) and a location (example: parking lot, your garage, coffee shop, hackerspace, a workshop, etc).  Register this information with us.  Fore more details go _here_.\r\n\r\n### Resources and Tools\r\nWe love tools!  We try to keep as many hardware and software tools listed in one location as possible.  We focus on cheap and/or open source tools.  If you have a commercial tool we still might list it but you will have to make a good case for it.\r\n\r\nHere is our Tool repository...\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\nCurrently this page is a work in progress.  We are moving the media wiki over to github so a lot of content may not be moved over yet.  Be sure to also check http://opengarages.org/ for additional information during this transition period\r\n",
